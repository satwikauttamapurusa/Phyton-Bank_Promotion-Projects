**Bank Promotion Projects**

**Background Case**: 
  Revobank is a European bank that provides credit cards for customers. The projects within the Card Partnership tribe, aim to increase the usage of Revobank credit cards in partnership with various merchants. One of Revobank's partnerships is Revoshop. Over the past 6 months, Revobank implemented a new promotion for credit card users. After running the promotion, Revobank wants to know about the spending patterns of customers who are Revobank credit card users. on the other side, they want to find ways to reduce the cost of the promotion.

**Objective** : 
- Identify customer behavior based on customer segmentation
- Discover business recommendations based on customer segmentation
  
**Summary Results** :
- The total number of users of Revoshop is 107658 user. Overview of the promo for 6 months, there 72.67% of users who sensitive to the promo, and 27.32% who not sensitive to the promo. For promo lifetime, there is 68.55% of users who sensitive to the promo, and 31.44% of users who not sensitive to the promo. This means most of the users Revoshop sensitive with promo

- The segment users are divided by RFM Segmentation. We using RFM segmentation because we want to separate customers by last transaction, frequency of customers using promo, and total purchased customers by promo. Segmentation Customers are divided into groups: 

-Champions:	Bought recently, buy often, and spend the most!
-Loyal Customers:	Spend good money with us often. Responsive to promotions.
-Potential Loyalist:	Recent customers, but spent a good amount and bought more than once.
-Recent Customers:	Bought most recently, but not often.
-Promising:	Recent shoppers, but haven’t spent much.
-Customers Needing Attention:	Above average recency, frequency, and monetary values. May not have bought it very recently though.
-About To Sleep:	Below average recency, frequency, and monetary values. Will lose them if not reactivated.
-At Risk:	Spent big money and purchased often. But a long time ago. Need to bring them back!
-Can’t Lose Them:	Made biggest purchases, and often. But haven’t returned for a long time.
-Hibernating:	The last purchase was long back, with low spenders and a low number of orders.
-Lost: Lowest recency, frequency, and monetary scores.

*Based on higher sales by average transaction lifetime, the top 3 segmentation customers are the promising group, the recent customer group, and the at-risk group.
*Based on higher frequency transaction lifetime, the top 3 segmentation customers are the potential loyalist group, the at-risk group, and the champions group
*Based on higher revenue, the top 3 segmentation customers are At risk group, the champions group, and the promising group.

**Business Recommendation** : 
- Based on customer segmentation we can conclude, the at-risk group is always in top 3 for higher sales, frequency, and revenue. They are users who spend big money and purchase often, but a long time ago. so we can focus on that segmentation to increase sales, frequency, and revenue. we can give them more promo or rewards to make them back to the behavior which is purchase often and spend big money
- Second group, we suggest focusing on the champions group. They are bought recently, buy often, and spend the most. they are in the top 3 for frequency and revenue. which means the frequency of the champions group contributes good revenue. we can give them some promo for more frequency buying or we can give 'specials' promo. 
so the cost of promo can focus on the two segmentation
